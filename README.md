# Fractured State
This is just about all the code I wrote for Fractured State. I put up here for archival purposes and decided to make it public in case anyone might learn from it (since RTS mechanics are fairly complex).

This won't compile out of the box because certain libraries are omitted due to licensing.

Fractured State was in development for a long time, originally targeting Unity 5.x and upgrading throughout its lifetime until ultimately landing on 2017.1.0p4. Due to that fact, you'll see some cruftiness that was never resolved (ie - globally namespaced MonoBehaviours).

If you'd like to play what was ultimately the last Early Access version we released, it's $0.99 here
